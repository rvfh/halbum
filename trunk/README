DESCRIPTION

This is a multilingual online photo album generation program. The name halbum
has been chosen to follow in the path of my backup program: hbackup.

Why yet another photo album program? Because I wanted something geared towards
what I need: multilinguage support, headless operation, low memory/CPU usage.

Please read the INSTALL file to find out about necessary external programs.

BASIC OPERATION

In the root of the photo albums collection (for example a 'photos' directory),
you want to copy (or link) the halbum script and the flags and names
directories.

You can then create directories for your albums in that root directory, such as
'summer holidays 2006' or 'Pierre, 3 years old'.

In each directory, create a 'originals' subdirectory and put your original
photos in there.

The structure will look like this:

photos
|-- summer holidays 2006
|   `-- originals
|       |-- summer 1.jpg
|       `-- summer 2.jpg
`-- Pierre, 3 years old
    `-- originals
        |-- PIERRE 356.JPG
        `-- PIERRE 427.JPG

Now run halbum like so: './halbum' (from the root) or './halbum <path to root>.

Amongst other things, halbum will create files called titles-en.text where you
can define the title of the album and a comment for each picture.

OTHER LANGUAGES

By default, halbum creates a 'languages' file for each album containing 'en',
for English. You can add other languages here. 'br' (for Brazil) and 'fr'
(for France) are supported so far.

You can of course create the languages file with you own languages prior to
running the script.
